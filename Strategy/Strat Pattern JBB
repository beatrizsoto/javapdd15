The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to decide which course of action 
a program should take, based on a specific context during runtime. You encapsulate two
different algorithms inside two classes, and decide at runtime which strategy you want to go with.

Strategy pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a
specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
